# Number Recognizer
Personal Repository

This is a number recognizer I built on the web using the Flask API for python. 
I used python instead of traditional Javascript becasue pythons version of Tensorflow is more powerful and easier to implement.
I created a simple model which you will have to unzip due to its size to recongize the choosen test case that the user inputs.
My main goal with this project was to create a proof of concept for further web design applications using python's version of tensorflow.
